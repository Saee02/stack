# stack
A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

Stacks work on the principle of LIFO Operation of stacks : push() to insert an element into the stack.the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition. pop() to remove an element from the stack.f the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.

Algorithm:

1 − Checks if the stack is full.

2 − If the stack is full, produces an error and exit.

3 − If the stack is not full, increments top to point next empty space.

4 − Adds data element to the stack location, where top is pointing.

5 − Returns success.
